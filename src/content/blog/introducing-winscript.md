# What is WinScript?

WinScript is an open-source tool designed to help users take control of their Windows environment by offering a range of features that includes debloating, privacy enhancement, performance optimization, and streamlined app installation scripts.

# Why WinScript?

Windows is known for its ease of use and broad functionality, but it's also known for shipping with bloatware and privacy concerns. Windows has background services, telemetry, data collection, and other features that can slow down your system and compromise your privacy. Many of these features run in the background by default, consuming system resources and collecting user data without clear, explicit consent. This can lead to reduced performance and concerns over how personal information is being used.

With WinScript you can build your own Windows script from scratch. You choose what apps to debloat (Only 3rd-party apps, Xbox Apps, Microsoft Apps, Extension Apps etc.), which data collection you want to disable (Windows Update, Search, Feedback, Clipboard etc.), and more to customize your script.

# What can I do with WinScript?

**_A few of the most useful tweaks you can apply with WinScript are:_**

- Remove Edge
- Remove CoPilot
- Remove OneDrive
- Disable Consumer Features (prevents windows from installing software without explicit consent)
- Disable Telemetry & Data Collection
- Set Services to Manual (will free up system resources by keep services running only when they are needed)
- Install all your apps in one click using Chocolatey.

# Is it open-source?

WinScript is completely free to use and open-source, licensed under the GPL-3.0, ensuring that it is transparent. The community is not only encouraged to use it but also to contribute to its ongoing development. If you’re a developer or someone who’s passionate about improving the Windows experience for everyone, you can easily get involved. Contributions are welcome, and you can find guidelines on how to help in the project's contributing guide.
